# canny-edge-detection
Implementation of a Canny Edge Detector as part of an assignment of the Computer Vision course from ENPC.
The influence of the value of the thresholds and of the standard deviation of the Gaussian Filter is discussed.

*Part 1*

Basic image processing is performed on *lena.jpg*

*Part 2* 
---
Canny edge detector is implemented. Code is segmented as follows:
1. Gradient computation
2. Non-Maximum Suppression
3. Gradient Thresholding
4. Hysteresis Thresholding to extract edges
5. Computing of the edges

Details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook above.
