# canny-edge-detection
Implementation of a Canny Edge Detector. The algorithm is tested on Lena.
The influence of the value of the thresholds and of the standard deviation of the Gaussian Filter is discussed.

*Part 1*
---
Basic image processing is performed on *lena.jpg*

*Part 2* 
---
Canny edge detector is implemented. Code is segmented as follows:
1. Gradient computation
2. Non-Maximum Suppression
3. Gradient Thresholding
4. Hysteresis Thresholding to extract edges
5. Computing of the edges

Details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook above.
